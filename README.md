1. Newton's Method

This begins by setting the function 'newton' with the parameters:

  (i) 'x' which represents the number that we want to find the square root.
  
  (ii) 'guess' which is an initial attempt at approximating the square root and represented as a float

  (iii) 'tol' which is the acceptable tolerance for the precison for the results.


x is the number for which we want to find the square root, guess is the current guess, and next_guess is an improved guess.

The function is set to iterate through the formula using a 'While Loop' until it reaches an acceptable level of precision where the difference between guess and next_guess is smaller than a specified tolerance (e.g., 1e-10 or a smaller value).
